<h3>How to contribute:</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<h4>Code:</h4>
You can contribute code using the GitHub repo. The process won't be
very efficient, because I am a total newbie to git and GitHub, but I am
(very) slowly learning.<br>
<br>
<h4>Documentation</h4>
You can improve the English documentation by contributing to the
gh-pages branch of the repo.<br>
You can also translate the documentation to your language. If you do
so,
please translate from the English version, which is the official one.
You can upload your translation to this webpage by commiting to the
gh-pages branch of this repo. If you don't know how to do this, please
send me by email the HTML file for your language. and I will upload it.<br>
<br>
I will need two things:<br>
<ul>
  <li>the HTML file itself (and any extra images that are not included
in the English version)<br>
  </li>
  <li>the name of your language <span style="font-style: italic;">in
your language</span> (for example: Portuguese → Português, Russian →
Русский, Chinese → 中文)</li>
</ul>
To translate to your language, I suggest you download the files in the
hg-branch of the repo and use the English version as your template, as
it allows you to reuse the images and the links.<br>
<br>
If possible, all translations should be made from to the English page,
which is the official one. However, if you don't feel capable of
translating from&nbsp; English, you can translate from your language of
choice<br>
<br>
There doesn't seem to be an easy way to translate the user interface
for my addon, and it will remain in English for the time being. You're
of course free to package and distribute a version "localized" to your
language. If there is massive demand for this, I might refactor the
code to keep all UI visible strings in the same file.<br>
